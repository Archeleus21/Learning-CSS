      example:
        first define a parent elemnt as the "flex container"
        any direct children become "flex items"
        then using various flex properties child items can be layed out in any direciton.

        when you define a "flex container" you define a flowdirection for the items inside of it.
          example:
            .container
            {
              display: flex;
              flex-direction: row;
            }
            .container
            {
              display: flex;
              flex-direction: column;
            }

        think of flexbox as layout the page from the content on out.
        child elements declare how they would like to interact with one another
        within their parent element flexbox container.
        so the layout is dependent on the content.
