    /*Element Positioning is a layout concept.  it is used
    to take an element on a page and control where and how it is positioned
    on a page relative to the other elements.*/
    /* there are 3 types of positioning,
    normal flow
    element floating
    absolute Positioning*/
    /*normal flow is when you do nothing to position the elements, a default layout.
    -block-level elements such as
    headings
    paragraphs
    divs
    articles
    aside
    and more fall into this catagory;
    -Inline Elements fall into the block-levels such as
    images
    links
    spans*/

    /*Position property
    accepts 1 of 5 values
    static, relative, absolute, inherit, fixed.  (inherit takes properties from parent)*/

    /*example of Relative Positioning:
    .box1
    {
      position: relative;
      left: 100px;
      top: 50px;
    }

          box1 (and down 50px)
    box2
    box3
    */

    /* example of Absolute Positioning:
        box 2 and 3 move up to fill the space since box1 has been removed from
        the normal document flow.
    .box1
    {
      position: absolute;
      left: 100px;
      top: 50px;
    }

    box2  box1(and down 50px)
    box3
    */

    /* example of Fixed Positioning:
        in fixed positioning the "logo" moves with the viewport
        and no matter where the user has scrolled to the "logo" stays
        in the same spot.
    .logo
    {
      position: fixed;
      top: 50px;
      left: 100px;
    }
    */

    /* position elements can stack on top of eachother:

    .content
    {
      z-index: 1;
    }

    .quote
    {
      z-index: 2;
    }
